# journey-to-web-developer
Hi, I’m Darrick Robarge, and this is the story of my journey to becoming a Full-Stack Developer.


## The Goal
My journey into web development has been guided by my commitment to The Odin Project, a comprehensive curriculum that’s helping me build a solid foundation in programming. With clear goals in mind, I’m focused on mastering the skills to become a confident and capable developer. I’ve set my sights on completing the program by July 18th, which is just seven months away. This timeline keeps me motivated, reminding me that with consistent effort, I’m closer every day to achieving my dream of building impactful web solutions.

## Curriculum
I’ve chosen to follow the Full Stack JavaScript path to gain both front-end and back-end skills.
